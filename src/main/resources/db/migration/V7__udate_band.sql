SET description = 'Nirvana was an influential American rock band formed in 1987 in Aberdeen, Washington, by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Known for their raw energy and powerful lyrics, Nirvana played a key role in popularizing the grunge genre, blending punk rock and heavy metal with introspective, often dark themes. Their breakthrough came with the release of *Nevermind* in 1991, featuring the iconic single "Smells Like Teen Spirit," which became a generational anthem.

Nirvana''s music reflected Cobain''s troubled emotions and societal disillusionment. Despite their success, the band dissolved in 1994 after Cobainâ€™s tragic death. Today, they are remembered as one of the most influential bands of the 1990s, shaping the sound of alternative rock.'
